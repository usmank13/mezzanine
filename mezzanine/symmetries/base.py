    """A symmetry family: different 'views' of the same underlying evidence.

    Examples:
      - image transforms (crop/flip, camera choice)
      - order / permutation of a list of statements
      - factorization / tool-call ordering
      - action representation choices (windowing, offsets)

    Symmetries are used in two places:
      - measurement: estimate how unstable a model is under symmetry variation
      - distillation: train a student to approximate the symmetry-marginal expectation
